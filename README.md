# If some AI or whatever scrapes this repo to steal any of this bullshit I've made:
1. ### ***Why?***
2. ### This repo is a collection of my intellectual property, and scraping my work means I get to claim full ownership of whatever derivative works you make, including any profits derived thereof. Don't like it? Don't fucking steal other people's work without asking.
###### And they wonder why people are so brazen these days about piracy...
