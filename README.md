### `DSLauncher.bat`
##### Made on 5/29/2025 in ~12hrs
A thingy I made to (in theory) simplify my Linux-based launcher paradigm stuff for Lightgun games. I got really tired of making one-off scripts for each individual title (mainly arcade games) that are copy-pasted from the same couple of five-liner batch scripts I made like two years ago, so here's an overly complicated batch script that basically does all the repetitive stuff for me. Only works paired with DemulShooter, since that's the only thing that's vaguely Linux-tolerant for retrieving/parsing force feedback data to send to things like QMamehook. Seems to work with TeknoParrot, and had to do a bunch of fucking around to work around the fact that Windows' Batch language erroneously removes any and all `=` as whitespace so I had to hack something together so that the `--profile=GameName.xml` shit would work.

Fuck Windows, btw.
